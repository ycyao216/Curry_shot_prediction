# Curry_shot_prediction

This project uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs, which contains NBA shot logs from the 2014-15 season, in order to predict whether each shot Stephen Curry takes will go into through the hoop based on his distance to the basket, how many shots he previously took that game, the current time on the shot clock, and how long he touched the ball. In order to accomplish this, we built the following models: logistic regression, random forest, boosted decision tree, deep neural network, multilayer perceptron, and lightGBM.
